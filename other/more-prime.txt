« more′»
(i.e., 'more prime')

more′ is an 'outliner,' also known as an 'outline processor.' The principal difference between a word processor and an outline processor is that an outliner's functionality, instead of producing standard letters or memoranda, is to organize paragraphs hierarchically, meaning that certain paragraphs are indented as subordinated 'children' items of superior 'parent' items; there can be multiple levels of the hierarchy, such that there may be 'children' of 'children,' i.e., 'grandchildren' of the original 'parents,' or with less family involvement, sub–sub–items of items and further down, with it being easy to rearrange the depth (hierarchical level) of an item as well as where, vertically, the item is located.
