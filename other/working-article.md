#### INFLUENCES
A number of the outliners and other software programs studied by the developers include, but are not limited to, those running on MS–DOS, Windows, Macintosh, NeXTSTEP, macOS and the internet, and include what was likely the first outliner, Mike Cowlishaw’s STET (STructured Editing Tool) ‘folding’ text editor for IBM VM/CMS written in 1977, which he followed, also for IBM machines, with the LEXX text editor, also a ‘folding’ text editor, in 1985.

Cowlishaw’s pioneering work influenced later primarily ‘text editor’ programs that offered the feature of ‘folding’ text k. Some of these, which the authors of pico’ have used and examined in detail, include ThinkTank, Acta, NoteBook (NeXTSTEP), MORE (early and late versions), ECCO Pro, GrandView, OmniOutliner, FoldingText, Frontier/OPML Editor, Little Outliner, Tree Outliner, Outlinely, Opal, Dynalist, Workflowy, org–mode, Evernote, Smartsheet, SheetPlanner, OneNote, Google Keep, Coda and Workflowy.

Outliners, which are also at times referred to as outline processors, are a specialized form of text editor (in which context ‘outlining’ is often referred to as ‘folding’) or word processor, which in either case is primarily intended for the creation and editing of these particular forms of documents that have an essential tree structure together with an essential hierarchy. These specialized text files, “items” (also known as ‘nodes’ in some situations) are arranged in a multi–level order and hierarchy which when loaded into an outliner, may have items collapsed or expanded to display as few or as many levels as desired.







### introduction

more´ (“more prime”) is an “outliner,” which are also known as “outline processors.” The fundamental concept of an outliner, that which sets the software and the outline itself apart from a text editor or word processor is that instead of the line or the paragraph, respectively, being the primary unit upon which the application operates, but an arbitrary segment of text, which can be from one word to a chapter of a book, that has been separated as a distinct ‘item’ from the other segments of text and that as an item can be rearranged easily and indented or outdented to create a hierarchy of these items
