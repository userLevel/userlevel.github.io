			<p>userLevel <b>'xc'</b> is a command line text editor similar to 'ed' or 'ex' being while being selection-based andresulting from use of of structural regular expressions from Rob Pike's 'sam' text editor; it is very much like running sam without samterm (i.e., 'sam -d'), however it only implements the commands which were distributed as tools with the inferno operating system for use with another text editor by Rob Pike, 'acme,' as 'sam' was not ported to inferno. for example, 'sam' has an 's' substitution command, primarily implemented to help 'ed' users adjust to the 'sam' command language, where the idiomatic 'sam' command used for this purpose is generally 'x' for extract.</p>
