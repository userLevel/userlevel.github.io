			<p>userLevel’s terminal– and web–based terminal <b>‘exch’</b> application is an interactive command line text editor similar to ‘ed’ or ‘ex’ (similarly to ‘ed’ or ‘ex,’ there is no ‘textual user interface,’ as there is with many terminal–based text editors commonly referred to as ‟command line" editors — see, e.g., the ‘nano’ text editor, however <b>‘exch’</b> does provide some niceties such as a relevant prompt) while being selection–based, as opposed to line based, and using structural regular expressions and the text editing command language as found in Rob Pike’s ‘sam’ text editor; it is very much like running sam without samterm (i.e., ‘sam -d’), however <b>‘exch’</b> only implements the commands which were distributed as tools with the inferno operating system for use with one of Rob Pike’s other and perhaps best known text editor, ‘acme,’ as ‘sam’ was not ported to inferno. for example, ‘sam’ has an ‘s’ substitution command, primarily implemented to help 'ed' users adjust to the 'sam' command language, where the idiomatic ‘sam’ means of substituting new text for existing text is to use the ‘x’ extract command. <b>‘exch’</b> is written almost exclusively in JavaScript, which allows it to be run as a node.js application in the terminal as well as serve as a web based application as well.
